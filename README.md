# Master Swift Generics

* Why do we need Generics ?

Generic code enables you to write flexible, reusable functions and types that can work with any type, subject to requirements that you define. 
You can write code that avoids duplication and expresses its intent in a clear, abstracted manner.

* What is a placeholder type in Generics ?

The placeholder type T is an example of a type parameter. 
Type parameters specify and name a placeholder type, and are written immediately after the functionâ€™s name, between a pair of matching angle brackets (such as <T>).
